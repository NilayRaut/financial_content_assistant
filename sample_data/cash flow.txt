Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) reported a staggering $115.9 billion in operating cash flow (OCF) in 2024, a third more than the year before.1 That's enough to buy every person in the state of California two new iPhone 16 Prosâ€”with billions more left over.2

Key Takeaways
Operating cash flow (OCF) is the first section of a cash flow statement, showing cash from investing and financing activities.
OCF is calculated using an indirect or direct method.
The OCF indirect method of calculation starts with net income, which is then adjusted for noncash items.
The OCF direct method tracks actual cash transactions.
A positive OCF indicates a company can fund its operations from its core business activities without relying on external financing or investment capital.
What Is Operating Cash Flow (OCF)?
OCF measures the amount of cash generated by a company's core business operations over a specific period. It's the cash inflows and outflows directly related to producing and selling the company's products or services. OCF specifically excludes cash flows from investing activities (like purchasing equipment) and financing activities (such as issuing stock or paying dividends).4

More specifically, we can formulate OCF as follows:

OCF = Net Income + Non-Cash Expenses + Increases in Working Capital
OCF provides a clear picture of how much cash a business generates from its day-to-day operations before considering any external funding sources or capital expenditures. This makes it crucial when assessing a company's operational efficiency and whether it's sustainable financially. By focusing solely on core business operations, OCF helps investors and analysts determine whether a company can support itself through its primary business model.5

Companies report OCF as part of their cash flow statement, which breaks down all cash movements into three categories: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Below is the 2024 statement from Amazon's 10-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
