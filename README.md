# Financial Content Assistant

**Financial Content Assistant** is an intelligent, document-driven financial assistant.
It allows users to upload their own financial documents (PDF or TXT), and query them using natural language.

This project uses semantic search and vector embeddings to provide relevant and context-aware answers based on user-uploaded content.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload financial documents (PDF, TXT)
- Process and chunk documents for efficient retrieval
- Build a vector database of document embeddings
- Perform semantic search to find relevant information
- Answer natural language questions about the documents
- Simple and user-friendly interactive interface

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI Embeddings** (or HuggingFace alternatives)
- **Chroma/FAISS** for vector storage
- **IPython Widgets** for UI (if running in Jupyter)
- **pandas** for data handling

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-content-assistant.git
   cd financial-content-assistant
   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🧐 How It Works

1. Upload your financial documents (.txt or .pdf).
2. The documents are processed and split into smaller text chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded into a vector space using a language model.
4. A semantic search finds the most relevant document parts for your query.
5. The assistant answers your question using the retrieved context.

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

- Analyze your company's quarterly financial reports
- Find key financial metrics quickly across documents
- Prepare financial analysis without manually reading long PDFs
- Extract risks, opportunities, and trends from financial statements

---

## 📢 Future Enhancements

- Add OCR support for scanned PDFs
- Multi-modal search (tables, graphs)
- Summarization feature
- Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Gradio
